MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) Overview

MPLS is a routing technique that directs data from one node to the next based on short path labels rather than long network addresses.

Key Components:
- LER (Label Edge Router): Adds or removes MPLS labels
- LSR (Label Switch Router): Forwards packets based on labels
- FEC (Forwarding Equivalence Class): Group of packets forwarded the same way
- LSP (Label Switched Path): The path packets take through the network

MPLS-TE (Traffic Engineering):
MPLS-TE extends basic MPLS by allowing network operators to explicitly control the path that traffic takes through the network. This enables:
- Bandwidth reservation
- Load balancing
- Fast reroute capabilities

Configuration Commands:
- enable mpls ip: Enables MPLS on an interface
- show mpls ldp neighbor: Displays LDP neighbors
- show mpls forwarding-table: Shows the MPLS forwarding table

SDN and MPLS:
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can program MPLS paths dynamically through a centralized controller, enabling more flexible network management.

NFV (Network Functions Virtualization):
NFV replaces physical netwo
rk devices with software-based virtual network functions (VNFs), allowing MPLS edge routers to run as virtual machines.
