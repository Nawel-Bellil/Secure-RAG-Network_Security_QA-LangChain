Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data.
There are three main types:
- Supervised Learning: learns from labeled examples
- Unsupervised Learning: finds patterns in unlabeled data  
- Reinforcement Learning: learns through trial and error

Deep Learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns.
It powers applications like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.

Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
