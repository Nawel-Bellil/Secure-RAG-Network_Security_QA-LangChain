Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. 
It enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

There are three main types:
1. Supervised Learning - learns from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - learns through trial and error

Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
Deep Learning uses neural networks with multiple layers.
